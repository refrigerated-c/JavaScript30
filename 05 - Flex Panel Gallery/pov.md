## some new things

**flex: 1 - which is short hand for flex-grow, flew-shrink, flex-basis,which expand to fill all available space in a container equally, better than manually setting width: 30%, etc.

can epxand space - 2, 3 (https://youtu.be/_2vijZ-yRfw) 

**translate- for repositioning items
**translateX - horizantally 
**translateY - vertically
**(-30px) - with X moves 30px to left and with Y moves 30 px up
**(30px) - with X moves 30px to right and with Y moves 30 px down
**% is also like translateX(100%) moves to 100% of its own width to right 

**toggle - switch from one effect, feature, or state to another 
**classList - this property is to use add, remove and toggle CSS classes on an element

## Steps
1. we set all flex properties on panels (center it all)
2. some animation using transform:translate
 + creating a class open-active we added a magical touch of appearing of first and last text.

-Most of the styling is been done , In JS , only 2 eventListner has been added 
'click' and 'transitionend'
and in that though functions added are inter connected with css styling.
