## some new things

*flex: 1 - which is short hand for flex-grow, flew-shrink, flex-basis,which expand to fill all available space in a container equally, better than manually setting width: 30%, etc.

can epxand space - 2, 3 (https://youtu.be/_2vijZ-yRfw) 

*translate- for repositioning items
translateX - horizantally 
translateY - vertically
(-30px) - with X moves 30px to left and with Y moves 30 px up
(30px) - with X moves 30px to right and with Y moves 30 px down
% is also like translateX(100%) moves to 100% of its own width to right 

## Steps
1. we set all flex properties on panels (center it all)
2. some animation using transform:translate
 + creating a class open-active we added a magical touch of appearing of first and last text.
